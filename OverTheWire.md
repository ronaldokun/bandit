## 1 - 2: Read a dashed `-` file
> This type of approach has a lot of misunderstanding because using - as an argument refers to STDIN/STDOUT i.e dev/stdin or dev/stdout .So if you want to open this type of file you have to specify the full location of the file such as ./- .For eg. , if you want to see what is in that file use cat ./-

## 2 - 3: Spaces in filename
> Same logic from the previous, if you want to use special linux cli characters such as - or -- in a file name, just provide the full path to the file and also just scape spaces when present.
